# Exoskeleton-Arm
## An Independent Project(Group Project)
An exoskeleton arm which helps you to lift up heavy projects with very little efforts. We have made a structure using wooden sticks and aluminium rods, then for the rolling mechanism purpose we used car-wiper motor(because it's cheap in price). Using arduino we have programmed the angle of rotation(around 60-70degree) and speed for the wiper-motor so that it can't roll beyond our hand movement and it's safer to use. To power up the arduino and wiper motor we have used 3 lithium-ion batteries. 

## Challenges:
1.The very first challenge is the programming of angle of rotation and speed of wiper motor. As we had just completed 1st sem and being from CSE background I don't know how to use arduino so we took help from seniors, batchmates and professor.

2. The next challenge is the power source, i.e. 3 li-ion batteries are not sufficient to power up for more than 5-7trials. So I have used arduino charger to power up.
<br>
3. And the last challenge is the designing of model. It's the toughest job ever. Working in fabrication lab for more than 5-6hours. 

## Achievements:
1. We have presented it in Elan&nvision and among 20-25projects from all other colleges we stood 2nd position and won Rs.2000 cashprize.
